                     </a>
                     <p> We went to Maui islands for our honeymoon. We went snorkeling to molokini crater. The reefs and the fishes were colorful. A huge turtle was so close to me, my husband was too scared that he pushed me towards it so he could escape. Haha, he was not afraid of the turtle, but the fine. Yess, if you touch them you have to pay 20000$. Scary right? 
                     The house of sun - Halaekala National park is the best sunrise I had seen.  The sun rising above the clouds, the change in the colour of the clouds and the beautiful rays was so beautiful. 
                     Road to Hana was yet another best roadtrip.

                  <h3>Lake Tahoe</h3>
                     <p>We went on a trip to Lake Tahoe. It was a sudden tirp. One weekend we decided to go on a trip. So the nearest being lake tahoe, we went there. It was my first trip after I came to US. It was so beautiful. Like everyone we did kayaking and parasailing. The lake was deep blue on the day we went, luckily the sky was clear. The water was a little cold though. On the way back my husband took me to a place to show me the snow which has been there for months.  And again recently we went to Lake Tahoe for my first snow. It sure feels like heaven. </p>

                     <p> My brother lives in Charlotte. We visited his place for my nephew's birthday. I loved the place, it was less crowded than here. The weather was good, when we were in his place. We went to Blue Ridge Parkway to see the fall colours. That was my first time seeing fall colours. In India there is no fall season. Leaves are either green or yellow or brown. So this was my first time and it was so pretty. My parents came along with us, and my mom loved it. She was so happy. And we were busy planning the birthday party for my one year old nephew. It was a fun time.

                     <p> We were watching a movie, and was telling my husband about a tree in that movie. I was telling him that I want to hide in a tree just like that, I wonder how it looks inside. Is it really spacious and tall? I asked. He smiled at me. And then few days later he took me on a trip to this national park. And there, I saw the tree. I was so happy, I enjoyed the tree and standing inside the tree. It was a little scary - just the thought of being inside a tree. But I loved it, felt like one thing off my bucket list.

                        My father-in-law wanted to see was an aquarium. So we went on a trip to San Diego. We went to the Sea World, had very good time. We loved the killer whale show. 
                        The net day we went to Universal studios. This is the first time for the four of us. The Harry potter ride was my favorite. The hologram 3D and the coaster ride was so real and best experience. My mother in-law enjoyed the tour - King Kong ride and the place crash site from the movie 'WAR OF THE WORLDS'. It was an amazing trip and I am waiting to take my parents there.

                        <p>I have been to many places to India. I love Kodaikanal a hill station near my place. We go there for summer. Pondicherry is a French colony which I enjoyed visiting quite often. The rock beach and Aurobindo ashram are the best spots there. I have been to other places like Checcai, Bangalore, Mysore, Mahabalipuram, Papikondalu, Srirangam and many other. But my favorite spot is the thiruvalluvar statue in Kanyakumari. Kanyakumari is in the South, it is the tip of India. The sunset is beautiful to watch in Kanyakumari. </p>
